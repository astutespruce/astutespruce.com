### Enhanced Exploration tools for Estuaries along the West Coast of the United States

Estuaries are unique ecosystems where rivers and streams meet the ocean. They provide
essential habitat to many aquatic and marine species. In particular, they provide
nursery habitat for several key species along the West Coast of the United States.

The [West Coast Estuaries Explorer](https://estuaries.pacificfishhabitat.org/)
provides an easy-to-use data-driven tool for exploring information about
estuaries along the West Coast of the United States. Our primary goal was to
make information about these estuaries more easily accessible, and leverage
recent work to map the extent of estuaries using high-resolution data sources.

This tool allows users to:

- explore and find estuaries along the West Coast
- visualize the location and types of biotic habitat within these estuaries
- easily filter estuaries by characteristics such as size and species present
- explore information about tidal wetland loss and restoration

I originally worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service - North Pacific Landscape
Conservation Cooperative and the [Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership](http://www.pacificfishhabitat.org/)
to create this tool during 2017-2018 while I was at the [Conservation Biology Institute](https://consbio.org) (CBI).
We then enhanced this tool further during 2019 to add additional information and functionality
around tidal wetland loss.

  Astute Spruce is a real pleasure to work with. Brendan is a truly impressive
  technical expert that listens carefully, suggests a range of solutions and
  reliably follows through on projects. He has a knack for distilling complex
  datasets and building clean, responsive and intuitive web mapping and data
  visualization applications. I highly recommend engaging Brendan early on in a
  project to take advantage of his insights from the start.
