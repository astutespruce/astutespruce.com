    I helped lead a workshop focused on integrating bat acoustic monitoring
    portals in order to create a more cohesive, centralized data system.  This
    system will make it easier for users to share data they are already
    collecting about bats and empower scientists and decision makers with
    greater breadth, depth, and quality of data on bats.

### Improving Integration Between Bat Monitoring Efforts

There are many efforts across North America to monitor bats using acoustic
detectors, in order to better understand bat biology, the impact of various
threats - such as wind turbines - on bats, and to get a baseline measaurement of
bat populations.

Bats use high frequency sound pulses to help them navigate their environment and
find prey. This is known as echolocation. Bat detectors take advantage of these
echolocation calls by listening for bats at a given location. Depending on the
degree of post-processing of the echolocation recordings and species involved,
it is sometimes possible to determine which which bat species were near a given
detector on a given night.

When you aggregate this information up across many detectors over large areas
and longer time periods, you can start to build an understanding of where
different species of bats are located throughout the year. While some species
hibernate in caves and are thought to become much less active during winters in
the northern hemisphere, other bats migrate over large regions. However, these
migration patterns are poorly understood, in part due to the difficulty in
tracking bats throughout the season. Using large numbers of acoustic detectors
across the continent is essential for improving our scientific understanding of
these migration patterns.

Likewise, if you use a consistent approach to capturing this information over
large areas, you can start to build statistical models of where bats are likely
to be present or not. Over time, if you capture this information repeatedly, you
can start to understand the trends in this likelihood, and therefore determine
whether or not bats are increasing or decreasing in their use of broad areas of
the landscape. This information is critical for detecting and responding to the
impacts of various threats on bat populations, such as diseases like white-nose
syndrome.

Given the high value in centralizing bat acoustic monitoring data over large areas, using
data from many different contributors, there have been multiple efforts to
create centralized databases at the regional and continental level.

In November 2019, I helped lead this workshop to define a more cohesive vision for a
continental-scale bat acoustic monitoring system that leverages these existing
efforts, while streamlining the data processing requirements for data
contributors. Specifically, we mapped out ways to integrate the
[Bat Acoustic Monitoring Portal](https://batamp.databasin.org/) with the
[North American Bat Monitoring Program](https://www.nabatmonitoring.org/),
and plan toward ways to integrate with cloud-based bat data processing
capabilities currently under development by
[Bat Conservation International](http://www.batcon.org/) and
[Conservation Metrics, Inc](http://conservationmetrics.com/).

The Bat Acoustic Monitoring Portal is an effort led by the USDA Forest Service,
and is built using the [Data Basin](https://databasin.org) platform to enable
user-uploaded data. Launched in 2013, many bat biologists have shared their data
using this system. We recently launched a companion tool, the
[Bat Acoustic Monitoring Visualization Tool](https://visualize.batamp.databasin.org/),
which showcases some of these data and highlights the great value in centralizing
acoustic monitoring data.

The North American Bat Monitoring Program is an ambitious, multi-scale effort
led by the U.S. Geological Survey to bring together several different types of
bat monitoring data across the continent to develop a better understanding of
the current status and trends of bat populations. A key
component of this effort is the use of a systematic, repeatable sampling
approach that will allow scientists to develop statistically rigorous analyses
of bat occurrence across large areas. More recently, this program has launched a
data portal that allows users to upload their monitoring data.

Bat Conservation International and Conservation Metrics are working on exciting
new ways to process massive amounts of acoustic monitoring data using
cloud-based data pipelines. They've discovered that the desktop-based,
manual approaches used in the past for analyzing bat acoustic data can no longer
keep up with the increasing volumes of data being collected across the continent.
These new approaches promise to liberate individual bat data contributors from
some of the laborious tasks required to be able to share their data into centralized
systems like those listed above.

This workshop was a pivotal step in aligning the goals between these efforts
toward a larger, shared vision. While the next steps for aligning these systems
will take several months to complete, all participants of the workshop came away
with clearly defined next steps to move us toward these broader goals.

Over the long term, our efforts will contribute toward a better understanding of
bat biology, a better understanding how bats move around over space and time,
and a better ability as a society to safeguard the long-term viability of bat
populations across the continent.
