### Improving Access to Project Data

The [Southeast Aquatic Resource Partnership](https://southeastaquatics.net/)
partners with several organizations throughout the Southeast U.S. to
improve aquatic habitat quality and connectivity. As one of the
[National Fish Habitat Partnerships](http://www.fishhabitat.org/) and
through partnerships with various other state and federal organizations,
they manage and help fund aquatic conservation projects in the region.

This also brings with it several responsibilities that include reporting
essential project information and accomplishments to their board as well
as their funders and partners. However, tracking this information in a
structured way that allowed SARP to generate reports was putting an
increasing burden on SARP's staff.

To help make it easier to access and manage this project tracking database,
we migrated the database from a Microsoft SQL Server database on a
contractor-hosted server that was virtually inaccessible to Postgresql
within Amazon Web Services.

As part of the migration, we worked to streamline the database structure
and reports, to make it as easy as possible for SARP staff to enter and
maintain key project information and generate reports. This should
help ease the burden on SARP's staff, and empower SARP to more readily
prepare the necessary reports for their board, funders, and partners.

While the current budget did not permit building a user-facing
application that makes working with this database easier, we did
make several improvements that will make that application easier to
implement once resources are available.
