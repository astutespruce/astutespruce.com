  The New Zealand Department of Conservation needed to test budget allocation
  approaches as part of its 10-year master budget planning. I created a rapid
  pilot application to help the department quickly visualize, compare, and
  evaluate different approaches to allocating budgets as part of this overall
  effort.

### Improving Government Budgets & Outcomes

Let's face it, a budgeting cycle for a large government agency is normally
associated with countless spreadsheets and endless meetings. It is often a slow,
bureaucratic, and hard-to-visualize process. It does not necessarily optimize
for effective, measurable outcomes, nor does it promote collaboration between
different groups within a department to achieve better buy-in and integrated
problem-solving.

The [New Zealand Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz/) (DOC) is
actively trying to improve this budgeting process in order to make better
decisions that will impact natural, social, and historical resources in New
Zealand for decades to come. The DOC is currently in the middle of a 10-year
master budgeting process, which involves figuring out how to allocate limited
funds toward:

- preserving rare and sensitive species
- restoring and protecting ecosystems
- reducing the impacts of invasive species
- building effective regional partnerships
- increasing visitor engagment with historical, cultural, and
  natural resources

In particular, the department is experimenting
with two approaches that may dramatically improve this process:

1. **decision theater** meetings, where stakeholders and decision-makers from
   multiple areas within the department collaborate to make tradeoffs between
   their goals and the available resources.

2. **budget allocation & visualization tools**, which enable stakeholders to
   quickly visualize the impact of budget decisions on department goals, and likewise, the potential cost to reach different targets.

Together, these will likely create a more collaborative budgeting process, which
will increase the department's ability to optimize the allocation of limited
budget resources toward achieving department goals.

### A Rapid Prototype to Visualize Budgets and Outcomes

In partnership with [KDV Decision Analysis, LLC](http://www.kdv-decisions.com/), we created a rapid prototype application to help the DOC interactively adjust target outcome levels and budgets.

Based on draft budgets and target outcomes from DOC, this application allows DOC
decision-makers and their support staff to easily adjust target outcome levels
for a variety of department goals. The application shows updated budget
information in realtime, making it very easy to visualize the impact of
different allocation levels.

This application also includes a multi-screen version, which shows different
aspects of the budget and target outcomes across a several physical screens in a
meeting room. This allows multiple staff to easily visualise budget impacts to
their area of responsibility, and more readily engage with data-driven decisions
during collaborative meetings to determine how funding should be allocated to
better reach DOC's goals.

This prototype is actively being used to evaluate and improve the budget
allocation process.

Over the mid and long term, this application (once more fully developed) will:

- empower decision-makers and their support staff to leverage available information on the impacts and outcomes of different budget allocations across the department
- increase budget allocation transparency during the decision-making process
- better optimize he assignment of resources to meet the larger objectives of the department.

We hope that by using this pilot application, the department will more fully
appreciate the benefits of the resource allocation process and leverage those
benefits to make more informed and durable budgetary decisions. In turn, DOC
hopes this will lead to increased conservation successes and greater engagement
between New Zealanders, foreign tourists, and partners around New Zealandâ€™s rich
natural heritage and cultural resources.
