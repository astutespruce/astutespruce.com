  The New Zealand Department of Conservation needed to test budget allocation
  approaches as part of its 10-year master budget planning. I created a rapid
  pilot application to help the department quickly visualize, compare, and
  evaluate different approaches to allocating budgets as part of this overall
  effort.

### Background

The [New Zealand Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz/) (DOC) is in the middle of a 10-year master
budgeting process. This includes figuring out how best to allocate limited
funds toward:

- preserving rare and sensitive species
- restoring and protecting ecosystems
- reducing the impacts of invasive species
- building effective regional partnerships
- increasing visitor engagment with historical, cultural, and natural resources

The DOC is evaluating different approaches to allocating these funds as part of
this budgeting process. These include tools and forum-style meetings that
empower decision-makers with the ability to easily see the impact of
different different budget allocations on DOC's goals and objectives.

### Project Goals

The primary goal of this project was to create a pilot budget allocation
application that enables DOC decision makers to easily adjust budget allocations
toward a range of desired outcomes and evaluate the overall progress toward DOC
goals and impacts on DOC's overall budget.

This tool is actively being used to refine DOC's approach to budget allocation,
including testing forum-style meetings where different aspects of the DOC's
budget and target outcomes are shown across a several physical screens in a
meeting room. This allows multiple staff to easily visualise budget impacts to
their area of responsibility, and more readily engage with data-driven decisions
to determine how funding should be allocated to better reach DOC's goals.

### Broader Outcomes

The broader outcomes of this project are to better empower decision-makers and
their support staff in DOC to leverage available information on the impacts and
outcomes of different budget allocations across the department, increase budget
allocation transparency during the decision-making process, and better optimize
the assignment of resources to meet the larger objectives of the department.

The hope is that by using this pilot application, the department will more fully
appreciate the benefits of the resource allocation process and leverage those
benefits to make more informed and durable budgetary decisions. In turn, DOC
hopes this will lead to increased conservation successes and greater engagement
between New Zealanders, foreign tourists, and partners around New Zealandâ€™s rich
natural heritage and cultural resources.
