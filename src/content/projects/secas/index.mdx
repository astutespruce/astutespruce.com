### Improving Access to Conservation Blueprints in the Southeast U.S.

The [Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy](http://secassoutheast.org/)
(SECAS) and [Southeast Blueprint Blueprint](http://secassoutheast.org/blueprint.html)
build on years of investment by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) and partners to develop, refine, and apply conservation blueprints to
advance on-the-ground conservation actions across the region. These blueprints
integrate the current condition of terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and
cross-ecosystem indicators to prioritize the most important areas for natural
and cultural resources.

We are working with the USFWS and partners to create online applications that
improve the ability for users to explore, understand, and apply the Southeast
Conservation Blueprint as well as underlying conservation blueprints and
landscape-level indicators within the region. Our primary deliverable will be
the Southeast Conservation Blueprint Explorer to be released in 2021.

**Goals:**

- Enable increased access to, understanding of, and ability to apply the
  Blueprint priorities and indicators to on-the-ground conservation. Help users to
  better meet their specific needs.
- Create better points of engagement between users, user engagement staff within
  USFWS and partners, and Blueprint data developers.
- Increase interest in participating in Blueprint improvements. This leads to a
  better Blueprint and adoption.
- Make it easier to identify and communicate strengths and weaknesses within the
  Blueprint across the region.
- Highlight shared conservation priorities and opportunities for greater coordination.
- Highlight information from State Wildlife Action Plans and similar efforts as
  they are incorporated into the Blueprint.

#### Building on Prior Efforts

While at the [Conservation Biology Institute](https://consbio.org), I led the
development of the [South Atlantic Conservation Blueprint Simple
Viewer](https://blueprint.southatlanticlcc.org/) (SA Simple Viewer). This application has been
highly effective at engaging users around the South Atlantic Conservation Blueprint.

We are leveraging the approach and lessons learned from this effort to
refine the SA Simple Viewer during 2020, and will
use that as the framework for creating the Southeast Conservation Blueprint Explorer.

We will be refining several of the most exciting features of the SA Simple Viewer.

- Expand and optimize a pixel-level exploration functionality, which allows users
  to easily see the Blueprint and indicator values for each pixel in the analysis.
  This is particularly helpful in understanding why a given area ranks high or low
  for the Blueprint. This uses the innovative
  [`datatiles`](https://github.com/brendan-ward/datatiles) approach we developed
  for the current version of the SA Simple Viewer.
- Expand the mobile-friendly version to include pixel-level exploration. The
  mobile version is highly useful for quickly communicating key aspects of the
  Blueprint in ad-hoc settings, without requiring a full desktop computer. This
  empowers USFWS staff to better communicate with partners around the Blueprint.

#### Better Communicating Conservation Priorities for an Area of Interest

We are currently developing the ability to create custom reports of the South
Atlantic Conservation Blueprint, underlying indicators, and associated
landscape-level threats within user-defined areas of interest. The original
version of the SA Simple Viewer was limited to providing pre-calculated
summaries for existing summary units (subwatersheds and marine lease blocks).
While these are reasonably useful for communicating general landscape
characteristics, they lack the level of detail that users need in order to
quantify the importance of an area of interest according to the Blueprint
and indicators.

Users are increasingly leveraging the South Atlantic Blueprint in grant proposals
and partnerships. In order to better support these uses, our new custom reports
will includes a rich suite of summary content including maps and summary tables
of the Blueprint, each indicator, and landscape-level threats such as sea level rise.
