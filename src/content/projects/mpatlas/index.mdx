### Major Update to the Marine Protection Atlas

Marine protected areas provide critical refugia for many marine species at multiple
points in their life histories. When effectively protected through stringent
regulations and active management to highly restrict extractive activities,
marine protected areas have been shown to help marine species better sustain
fishing and other activities outside their boundaries. Without marine preservation,
these species would be overfished, populations would crash, and marine ecosystems
as well as human populations that depend on them would become imperiled.

While roughly 6% of the world's oceans are protected through designated
protected areas, only 2.6% are highly protected from extractive uses. The
[Marine Conservation Institute](https://marine-conservation.org/) and partners
have set an ambitious goal to protect at least 30% of the world's oceans in
effective, highly-protected marine areas by 2030.

The [Marine Protection Atlas](https://mpatlas.org/) provides an easy-to-use,
data-oriented application that helps members of the marine protection community
better access, understand, and communicate key statistics on marine protection
at multiple levels around the globe. This new version leverages the efforts of
the Marine Conservation Institute to better evaluate the actual degree of marine
protection in place for each marine protected area.

This tool allows users to:

- explore over 13,000 marine protected areas around the world
- quickly filter marine protected areas according to different characteristics
- view key statistics of worldwide protection
- view country-level statistics of protection
- view details for each marine protected area

### Streamlining data processing

We worked closely with the Marine Conservation Institute to completely rebuild
the Marine Protection Atlas using modern technology while also reducing the
effort required to release updated information on marine protected areas.

Historically, calculating worldwide and country-level statistics on marine
protection involved several long-running, manual steps across multiple spatial
analysis platforms. The underlying data are highly complex: we have to sort out
issues around territorial sovereignty due to overlapping claims for exclusive
economic zones, as well as rectify overlapping areas of marine protection due
to different designating authorities or source databases.

We developed a data processing pipeline using open-source geospatial Python
libraries to better automate and streamline these tasks. This helps ensure that
it is easier to update the key statistics as updated information on marine
protected areas becomes available.

### Faster and feature-rich data exploration

We developed a brand-new user interface using GatsbyJS and Mapbox GL. GatsbyJS
allows us to build most of the website in advance, so that when users view it
in their browser, it is _fast_. Mapbox GL allows us to visualize map data
for over 13,000 marine protected areas and over 200 marine countries and territories
using a very high-performance rendering engine in the browser. This makes it
possible to easily filter marine protected areas by different criteria directly
in the browser, without requiring a sophisticated GIS server (and associated
licensing and / or maintenance costs).

We created all of the data visualizations from scratch to best communicate
highly-detailed information about marine protected areas without being visually
overwhelming. This helps synthesize a large amount of related information about
marine protection into a structure that makes it easy for members of the marine
protection community to quickly access and share detailed data on marine protection.

We have continued to improve the Marine Protection Atlas by adding additional
functionality, such as the ability to map, filter, and view more details on
marine protected areas assessed using the MPA Guide, which applies scientific
criteria to evaluating the actual degree of protection afforded by a given
protected area. We've also made it easier to view and download lists that identify
the largest marine protected and the most well-protected countries.
