        Too often, we get caught up in the cleverness of our tools and lose sight of meeting real-world needs.

        It is not the tool itself that matters, it is what you can do with it that matters.

        I partner with science-based organizations to amplify the impact of their work for a healthier world. Healthier ecosystems.

    <h1 class="mt-10 md:mt-20">What makes me different?</h1>
    <h3 class="mt-10">I bridge science and software.</h3>

    <p>
        With an advanced degree in landscape ecology and over 13 years professional experience in software engineering
        and geospatial technologies, I am highly effective at
        <b>bridging science and software</b> domains to capture the deep science domain experience of clients with
        cutting edge tools make that science accessible and engaging to their audience.
        <br />
        <br />
        What this means for you:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>
            I am passionately curious about understanding what you do and WHY, so that I can understand your data and
            leverage that to increase your impact.
        </li>
        <li>
            I take a rigorous experimental approach when developing a new application inspired by my science background.
            Often at the outset, the character of a new application is a bit unclear, and we discover it through the
            process of experimenting with different approaches and ways of presenting information to find the best fit.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-10 md:mt-20">I focus on impact</h3>
    <p class="mt-2 md:mt-0">
        The internet is filled with half-hearted applications that allow users to see data, but no clear actionable
        outcome. You know what? Those applications don&apos;t lead to insights or engagement, and they don&apos;t lead
        to greater impact.
        <br />
        <br />
        In contrast, I focus on impact from the start: how the application or tool effectively meets a real need and can
        measurably increase real impact. Is your goal to change user behavior and lead to real on-the-ground activities?
        Then whatever I build collaboratively with you needs to be strongly aligned around reaching that goal.
        <br />
        <br />
        What this means for you:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>
            I will work closely with you from the very beginning of a project to identify the real needs we are trying
            to solve. At each step in the development process, we measure ourselves against the impact we are ultimately
            trying to achieve.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-10 md:mt-20">I am highly collaborative</h3>
    <p class="mt-2 md:mt-0">
        I firmly believe that we are going to achieve higher impact, together. While I am very self-driven and highly
        successful at working independently, a highly successful project is the result of us working closely together to
        clearly identify needs and context, running experiments to explore possible solutions, and clearly targeting the
        impact you want to achieve through every stage of the project.
        <br />
        <br />
        What this means for you:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>
            I will actively involve you in the design and overall approach used for a project, and help you to
            understand the tradeoffs in design, implementation, and hosting options.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-10 md:mt-20">I am focused on simplicity</h3>

    <p class="mt-2 md:mt-0">
        It is easy to get caught up in hype and shiny tools. The tools are only a means to an end: if those tools are
        too complex, we spend all our time on them instead of what we should really be focused on:
        <i>impact</i>. Often, when trying to visualize information, teams get carried away with adding power tools for
        advanced users - only to find in the process that they&apos;ve alienated their core audience and missed their
        opportunity to have real impact.
        <br />
        <br />
        Instead, I focus on distilling things down as much as possible, to create a simple, intuitive experience. In practice,
        this is very difficult: simplicity is significantly more valuable over the long term than complexity, and also significantly
        harder to achieve.
        <br /><br />
        What this means for you:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>
            While I actively keep up on the latest trends and tools, I only leverage tools and approaches that best meet
            the need at hand with the lowest effort over the long term. Sometimes, a far simpler but less hyped solution
            is far superior over the long term.
        </li>
    </ul>

    />

    <h3 class="mt-10 md:mt-20">I am open source by default</h3>
    <p class="mt-2 md:mt-0">
        I believe that our tools get better when they are shared with and used by more people, and that by openly
        sharing something of value, we get something in return. I&apos;m not an open-source zealot though, so I will
        work with you to find the right balance for your project. In practice, many of the libraries I create are open
        source, and some of the applications I create for clients are not.
        <br /><br />
        What this means for you:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>
            I will leverage a range of open source solutions to deliver your project, including open source applications
            and libraries I&apos;ve created. Depending on the project, I will actively seek out ways to generalize our
            work into new libraries, because I firmly believe that is a better value to you over the long term.
        </li>
    </ul>
